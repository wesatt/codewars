This is a collection of most exercises I have completed for CodeWars.

There's not much to it. There are three directories:

- `docs` contains the instructions or prompt
- `lib` contains the code for the solution, in Ruby
- `spec` contains the tests, in RSpec

I try to comment my code and will sometimes write things for myself to remember.
